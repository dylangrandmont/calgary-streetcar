# Calgary Street Cars

This repository is a visualization of the street car network which existed in the city of Calgary, Canada prior to the 1950s.

## Context

Prior to WW2, streetcar networks were very common throughout North America.
These networks had frequent service, were well connected, and enabled people to live further beyond walking distance from their employment.
These networks enabled the first boom of "sub-urbanization", well before the widespread use of private automobiles.
Access to these networks was an important contributor to a lots value.
Developers would often petition city governments to construct these lines to support new neighbourhoods.
In Calgary, street cars connected residents to commercial districts in the city center, industrial sectors in Inglewood, Riverside, Manchester, and the CPR rail yards at the sourthern edge of the city.
One line of the network went to the natural parks at Bowness.

In the 1940s and 1950s, these networks were frequently dismantled in favour of bus service, and more importantly, the use of private automobiles.
